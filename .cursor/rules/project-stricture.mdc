This is a turborepo project with the following applications:

- frontend: built with remix run
- backend built with NestJS
- CMS built with Keystone

The frontend and backend use the same database, defined in in the root directory /packages/db, where the schema is defined [schema.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/schema.ts)

the db is shared, hence whenever the frontend/backend need to access the database, or type definitions which are used both by the database and the frontend and the backend, they all reference the packages/db folder
